# Dice-Game
For my 2nd project CIS 162 (Computer Science I) I created the die game program that determined the logic of the game such as losing or gaining credits based on the dice rolled. Some of the files that allows the game to function are missing as I did not write them.

# What I learned:
- Arrays
